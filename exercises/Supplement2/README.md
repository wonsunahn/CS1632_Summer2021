# CS 1632 - Software Quality Assurance
Summer Semester 2021 - Supplementary Exercise 2

* DUE: Jun 18 (Friday), 2021 11:59 PM 

**GitHub Classroom Link:** https://classroom.github.com/g/N2G6Q8Jz

## Description

In this exercise, we will test the Rent-A-Cat rental system software once more,
but this time with BDD (Behavior Driven Development).  

We will use the Gherkin language to specify behaviors for Rent-A-Cat and use
the Cucumber framework to test those behaviors.

## Prerequisites

I recommend that you do this on the Eclipse IDE since it is the easiest.

Please install the Cucumber plug-in for Eclipse following these steps (recommended):
1. Click on Help > Eclipse Marketplace.
2. Type "cucumber" in the Find search box and press Enter.
3. Install the "Cucumber Eclipse Plugin" that pops up in the search box.
4. You will be asked to restart Eclipse to complete installation.  Please do so.

Otherwise, you can use the command line Maven tool to install Cucumber.
But for that, you will need to install Maven first using the
following link (not necessary unless you want to run Cucumber on the command line and not on Eclipse): https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

## Running Cucumber Tests

### Running Cucumber Tests on Eclipse

To use the Eclipse Cucumber plug-in, first open the Eclipse project I have made for you:
1. Click on File > Open Projects from File System.
2. Click on Directory and browse to the folder where you have cloned your GitHub Classroom repository.
3. The "Supplement2" folder imported as "Eclipse project" checkbox should be auto-selected.
4. Click on the Finish button.

Then, run the Maven test goal:
1. Right click on the project root "RentACat-Cucumber".
2. Click on "Run as" in the context menu.
3. Select "Maven test".
4. Then the test results should be visible in the bottom Console window.

If you don't want to keep doing the above when running Cucumber tests, you can create a Run Configuration.
1. Click on Run > Run Configurations.
2. Select "Maven Build" in the list of run types at the left.
3. Click on the "New launch configuration" icon at the far left of the toolbar.
4. Edit the "Name:" box to something like "RentACat Cucumber Test"
5. Edit the "Base directory" box by clickig on the Workspace button and selecting the RentACat-Cucumber project.
6. Edit the "Goals:" box by inputing "test"
7. Click on the Apply button.

Now if you click on the little arrow beside the Run button on the toolbar that
looks like a play icon, you should see your newly made run configuration.

### Running Cucumber Tests on Commandline

If you are not using Eclipse and you wish to run the tests from the command line, use the command line Maven tool.  If you don't have Maven on your machine you need to [download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) it and [install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) it.  The PATH variable in the installation instructions is the same PATH we modified for setting up JDK 8 in the [Java Assessment Exercise](https://github.com/wonsunahn/CS1632_Summer2021/tree/main/exercises/0#setting-up-jdk-8-for-windows).  Once you make sure Maven works by doing `mvn -v`, do the following:

1. cd into the folder where you have cloned your GitHub Classroom repository.
2. Invoke 'mvn test':
    ```
    > mvn test
    ```

### Expected Outcome

Initially when you run the Cucumber tests, all your tests will fail, partly
because RentACatImpl is incomplete and partly because your Cucumber testing
code is incomplete.  You will get a long list of failures followed by this summary text:

```
...
Tests run: 14, Failures: 9, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD FAILURE
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  4.659 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2021-06-13T12:08:14-04:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.12.4:test (default-test) on project RentACat-Cucumber: There are test failures.
...
```

The above tells you that out of 14 tests, 9 tests failed, and there was an
error in one test.  An error happens when a test is incomplete or is otherwise
malformed.  In order to get the details about the failures and errors, you can
read the messages that precede the summary output, or you can also read the
Cucumber report which is much nicer.  Somewhere above that summary is going to
be a link to a report in red font that looks like this:

```
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
? View your Cucumber Report at:                                            ?
? https://reports.cucumber.io/reports/0334222f-8b03-4075-80ba-a63d2c887c90 ?
?                                                                          ?
? This report will self-destruct in 24h unless it is claimed or deleted.   ?
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
```

Copy and paste that link on a web browser and you should see a report that
looks like the following:

<img alt="Cucumber Report" src=img/cucumber_report.png width=700>

The green check marks indicate steps that have passed.  The red cross marks
indicate steps that have failed.  The blue square marks indicate steps that
were skipped because a previous step failed.  The yellow question marks
indicate steps that were erroneous (e.g. matching Cucumber step does not exist
for that step).  For the failed steps, a Java stack trace is attached so that
you can track down the failure.

## What To Do

You will modify three files: **RentACatImpl.java**, **StepDefinitions.java**,
and **rent_a_cat_return_cats.feature**.  The RentACatImpl class is the
(incomplete) implementation of the Rent-A-Cat system.  The StepDefinitions
class is the (incomplete) implementation of Cucumber steps corresponding to the
Gherkin steps.  The rent_a_cat_return_cats.feature file is a description of the
"return cat" feature in the Rent-A-Cat system written in the Gherkin language.
All the places to modify have been marked by // TODO comments.

### Updating RentACatImpl.java

Let's first start by completing src/main/java/RentACatImpl.java.  You can just
copy the version that you completed for Exercise 2.

You have to make an adjustment to the package name for RentACatImpl.java before
it will compile.  Put the following line at the top:

```
package edu.pitt.cs.cs1632;
```

Just by doing that, many tests will pass now.  Try invoking the Maven testing phase after having copied the
file and you will get:

```
> mvn test
...
Tests run: 14, Failures: 5, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0
...
```

Now we only have **5** failures where as previously we had **9** failures.  In
fact, all the tests in Feature: Rent-A-Cat listing (in the
src/test/resources/edu/pitt/cs/cs1632/rent_a_cat_list_cats.feature file) pass.

So why are the rest of the failures and errors happening?  We have rigorously
tested RentACatImpl using JUnit testing for Exercise 2, so hopefully by now it
does not contain any defects.  So then, there must be something wrong with the
Cucumber tests themselves!  Henceforward, we will fix the problems in the
Cucumber tests one by one and you will be able to learn Cucumber through that
process.

### Adding Steps in StepDefinitions.java for the "rent cats" Feature

Let's look at the
src/test/resources/edu/pitt/cs/cs1632/rent_a_cat_rent_cats.feature file to see
what the problem is.  Well, the Gherkin feature description makes logical
sense.  So it must be the Cucumber steps that implement the Gherkin steps that
must be the problem.  All the Cucumber steps are inside the
src/test/java/edu/pitt/cs/cs1632/StepDefinitions.java file.  In that file, you
can see all corresponding methods for each Gherkin step.  Some of the methods
have the // TODO: Implement comment and the default action is to fail().  The
failing methods are the ones used for the renting feature in Gherkin.  Replace
fail() with the proper implementation of each method.  Observe how other steps
were implemented to get hints.  After this, if you run Cucumber again, you will
get:

```
...
Tests run: 14, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0
...
```

### Further Modifying StepDefinitions.java and User Story for the "return cats" Feature

So where did this error come from?  If you scroll up in the Cucumber output a
little bit, you will see the following messages:


```
...
Attempt to return a cat that does not exist(Rent-A-Cat returning)  Time elapsed: 0.07 sec  <<< ERROR!
io.cucumber.junit.UndefinedStepException: The step "I return cat number 4" is undefined. You can implement it using the snippet(s) below:

@When("I return cat number {int}")
public void iReturnCatNumber(Integer int1) {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();
}


Some other steps were also undefined:

@Then("the return is unsuccessful")
public void theReturnIsUnsuccessful() {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();
}
...
```

Cucumber is telling you that there is no corresponding Cucumber step for the
Gherkin step "I return cat number 4".  And then, it is kind enough to even give
a code snippet you can use to start implementing that step!  Of course, you
will have to replace "throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();" with code
to actually implement that step.  Cucumber also tells you some additional steps
that were undefined as a courtesy.

Once you implement those steps, you may suffer a NullPointerException due to
the "r" reference being null.  Now why would that happen all of a sudden?
Hint: compare rent_a_cat_return_cats.feature where the error happened to the
rent_a_cat_rent_cats.feature, focusing on the "Background:" section.  Once you
fix that, you should finally get the following:

```
...
Tests run: 14, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 2.983 sec
...
```

Congratulations!  If you have time, try to complete the other 4 scenarios in
rent_a_cat_return_cats.feature and see if you can have them pass too!

## Submission

Each pairwise group will do one submission to GradeScope as usual.  The
submitting member must use the "View or edit group" link at the top-right
corner of the assignment page after submission to add his/her partner.  

Submit the repository created by GitHub Classroom for your team to GradeScope
at the **Supplementary Exercise 2 GitHub** link.  Once you submit, GradeScope
will run the autograder to grade you and give feedback.  If you get deductions,
fix your code based on the feedback and resubmit.  Repeat until you don't get
deductions.

### GradeScope Feedback

The feedback you get from the GradeScope autograder is based on the Cucumber
summary output.  For example, if you get the following output:

```
...
Tests run: 14, Failures: 9, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0
...
```

There were 9 failures and 1 errors so the final score is: 14 - 9 - 1 = 4.
